# README - TOM Recommender System 
## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a course recommender system for country-level managers within The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease(EuFMD). The recommender system is designed to identify and minimise gaps in emergency preparedness for FMD And Similar Transboundary animal diseases. The recommender will recommend courses that will bridge gaps in knowledge that exist among veterinary staff at a country level.

In other words, this recommender should do two things:
1. Identify skills gaps in veterinary professionals of a given country
2. Recommend courses that will help the country bridge the skills gaps most effectively 

## Context 

### Project status
As of July 2024 initial EDA has been completed and progress in identifying skills gaps has been made. Data cleaning and defining project scope has been the main focus.

### The Get Prepared Wall
The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease(EuFMD) has defined several skills that are necessary to prevent, combat, and recover from FMD and similar transboundary animal diseases. These skills are "bricks" listed in the "Get prepared wall" on the EuFMD website and are organised into four main categories:
1. Foundation
2. Alert
3. Emergency
4. Reconstruction

   Click [HERE](https://trello.com/b/SrsgHKzM/get-prepared-the-wall) to see the "Get prepared wall" and the skill "bricks" that make up each of these four categories

### Data used
The following datasets were used for the initial pilot/ EDA:
- tom_enrolments database: This was used to identify how many people within a country posessed a particular skill/ "brick". This data needed to be joined with other information in order to generate the necessary calculations
- Excel sheet with the "get prepared" brick mappings. This listed each course main topic and defined the skills/ "bricks" covered in each main topic. This was provided by a EuFMD staff member
