# README - TOM Recommender System 
## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a course recommender system for country-level managers within The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease(EuFMD). The recommender system is designed to identify and minimise gaps in emergency preparedness for FMD And Similar Transboundary animal diseases. The recommender will recommend courses that will bridge gaps in knowledge that exist among veterinary staff at a country level.

### The Get Prepared Wall
The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease(EuFMD) has defined several skills that are necessary to prevent, combat, and recover from FMD and similar transboundary animal diseases. These skills are listed ni the "Get prepared wall" and are organised into four main categories:
1. Foundation
2. Alert
3. Emergency
4. Reconstruction
